# go-mapscii
generate ascii maps in hex and grid patterns

You can currently make hex maps with this but I'm planning on doing a total overhaul over all the code and rewriting a lot of stuff. Until I get around to stabilising the project and actually making some more concrete decisions about design I wouldn't recommend that anyone use any of this code.
